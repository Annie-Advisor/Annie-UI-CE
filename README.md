# AnnieUI

Annie Advisor is a service for educational institutions for finding students in need of support. By finding their support needs early, interventions have the most impact and prevent dropouts from happening.

The Annie Advisor system consists of a front end service (this repository) and the [Annie API](https://github.com/Annie-Advisor/Annie-API-CE).
